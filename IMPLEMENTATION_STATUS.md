## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Enhance Operations Page (ONLY NEEDED CHANGE)

Add two missing tabs to `/dashboard/principal/operations/page.tsx`:

#### Tab 1: Finance
- Fee collection overview (from finance/)
- Payment tracking
- Invoice management
- Financial reports
- Payment analytics

#### Tab 2: Settings
- School settings and configuration
- Academic year setup
- System preferences
- User permissions
- Audit logs

**Implementation**:
```typescript
<Tabs defaultValue="attendance">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="attendance">Attendance</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="resources">Resources</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="finance">Finance</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="reports">Reports</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="settings">Settings</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  {/* Existing tabs */}
  <TabsContent value="attendance">...</TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="resources">...</TabsContent>
  
  {/* New tabs */}
  <TabsContent value="finance">
    {/* Migrate content from finance/page.tsx */}
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="reports">
    {/* System-wide reports and analytics */}
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="settings">
    {/* Migrate content from settings/page.tsx */}
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### Priority 2: Update Navigation

**File**: Check navigation configuration to ensure only 5 pages are shown:
- Home
- Academic  
- People
- Communication
- Operations

**Remove from navigation**:
- Assignments
- Events
- Finance
- Messages
- Reports
- Settings

### Priority 3: Clean Up Directories

After verifying all features are migrated:

```bash
# Remove placeholder directories
rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/assignments
rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/events  
rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/messages
rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/reports

# These need content migration first
# Move finance/ content to operations/ Finance tab
# Move settings/ content to operations/ Settings tab
# Then remove:
# rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/finance
# rm -rf src/app/dashboard/principal/settings
```

## Summary

### What's Already Done âœ…
1. Home page - Complete and functional
2. Academic page - Functional with classes, subjects, assignments
3. People page - Complete with full user management

5. Operations page - Functional with attendance and resources

### What Needs To Be Done ðŸ”§

- **Directory Cleanup**: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~8-10 hours

### Risk Assessment
