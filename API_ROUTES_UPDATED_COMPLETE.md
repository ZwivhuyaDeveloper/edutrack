## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: TEACHER tries to create school**
```bash
# Request
POST /api/schools
Authorization: Bearer <teacher-token>
Body: { name: "New School", ... }

# Response
403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Only principals and school administrators can create schools. Please contact your administrator."
}
```

### **Scenario 2: STUDENT tries to create organization**
```bash
# Request
POST /api/organizations
Authorization: Bearer <student-token>
Body: { name: "New Org", ... }

# Response
403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Only principals and school administrators can create organizations. Please contact your administrator."
}
```

### **Scenario 3: PRINCIPAL creates school**
```bash
# Request
POST /api/schools
Authorization: Bearer <principal-token>
Body: { name: "New School", ... }

# Response
201 Created
{
  "school": { id: "...", name: "New School", ... },
  "user": { id: "...", role: "PRINCIPAL", ... }
}
```

### **Scenario 4: New user (no role) creates school**
```bash
# Request
POST /api/schools
Authorization: Bearer <new-user-token>
Body: { name: "First School", ... }

# Response
201 Created
{

  "user": { id: "...", role: "PRINCIPAL", ... }
}
# User automatically becomes PRINCIPAL of the new school

## 🛡️ **Security Enhancements**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```typescript
// Check user role before allowing action
const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
if (!['PRINCIPAL', 'SCHOOL'].includes(currentUser.role)) {
  return forbidden()
}
```

### **2. School Ownership Verification**
```typescript
// Ensure user can only manage their own school
if (currentUser.schoolId !== targetSchoolId) {
  return forbidden()
}
```

### **3. Audit Logging**
```typescript
// Log all access attempts
console.log(`[POST /api/schools] User ${userId} (role: ${role}) creating school`)
console.warn(`[POST /api/schools] Access denied for user ${userId} with role ${role}`)
```

### **4. Data Validation**
```typescript
// Validate all input data
const validatedData = createSchoolSchema.parse(body)
```
