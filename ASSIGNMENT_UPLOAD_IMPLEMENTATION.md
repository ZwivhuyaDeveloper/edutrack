# Assignment Upload Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the assignment upload feature with file attachments for teachers.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `attachments String[]` field to the `Assignment` model (line 362)
- This allows teachers to upload multiple files (PDFs, DOCX, images, etc.) when creating assignments

### 2. File Upload Types & Utilities
**File**: `src/types/file-upload.ts`
- Defined allowed file formats:
  - **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT
  - **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
  - **Archives**: ZIP, RAR
- Set limits:
  - Max file size: **10MB per file**
  - Max files per assignment: **5 files**
- Created validation functions:
  - `validateFile()` - Checks file type and size
  - `formatFileSize()` - Formats bytes to human-readable format
  - `isValidFileType()` - Validates MIME type
  - `isValidFileSize()` - Validates file size

### 3. CreateAssignmentModal Component
**File**: `src/components/CreateAssignmentModal.tsx`
- Full-featured modal for creating assignments
- **Form Fields**:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Class selection (required)
  - Subject selection (required)
  - Due date (required)
  - Max points (optional)
  - File attachments (optional, up to 5 files)
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop file upload area
  - File validation with error messages
  - File preview with size display
  - Remove files before submission
  - Loading states during upload
  - Error handling and display

### 4. API Endpoints

#### File Upload Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
- Handles file uploads to server
- Validates file types and sizes
- Generates unique filenames with timestamps
- Stores files in `public/uploads/assignments/`
- Returns array of file URLs
- **Security**: Requires authentication

#### Assignment Creation Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/assignments/route.ts`
- **POST**: Creates new assignments with attachments
  - Validates required fields
  - Gets active term automatically
  - Stores attachment URLs in database
  - Only accessible to TEACHER, ADMIN, PRINCIPAL roles
- **GET**: Fetches assignments
  - Filters by role (students see their classes, teachers see their teaching assignments)
  - Supports filtering by classId and subjectId
  - Includes submission data

### 5. Teacher Assignments Page Updates
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/teacher/assignments/page.tsx`
- Integrated CreateAssignmentModal
- "Create Assignment" button opens modal
- Fetches assignments from API
- Refreshes list after successful creation
- Calculates statistics (total, pending, graded)

## Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
You need to run this command to update your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_attachments_to_assignments
```

If that fails, try:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Then generate the Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 2: Create Upload Directory
The upload endpoint stores files in `public/uploads/assignments/`. This directory will be created automatically on first upload, but you can create it manually:

```bash
mkdir -p public/uploads/assignments
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database connection:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
After running migrations, restart your Next.js dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage Flow

### For Teachers:
1. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Assignments
2. Click "Create Assignment" button
3. Fill in assignment details:
   - Enter title and description
   - Select class and subject
   - Set due date and max points
   - (Optional) Upload files by clicking "Select Files" or drag-and-drop
4. Click "Create Assignment"
5. Files are uploaded first, then assignment is created with file URLs
6. Assignment appears in the list immediately

### File Upload Process:
1. User selects files (validated client-side)
2. Files are uploaded to `/api/upload` endpoint
3. Server validates files again (security)
4. Files saved to `public/uploads/assignments/` with unique names
5. Server returns array of file URLs
6. Assignment created with attachment URLs in database
7. Students can access files via the URLs

## File Format Support

### Accepted Formats:
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.txt`
- **Images**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`
- **Archives**: `.zip`, `.rar`

### Validation Rules:
- Maximum 5 files per assignment
- Maximum 10MB per file
- Only allowed file types accepted
- Files validated on both client and server

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require Clerk authentication
2. **Authorization**: Only teachers/admins can create assignments
3. **File Validation**: Files validated by MIME type and size
4. **Unique Filenames**: Prevents file overwrites with timestamp + random string
5. **Server-side Validation**: Client validation is duplicated on server

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Cloud Storage**: Move from local storage to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or similar
2. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate antivirus scanning for uploaded files
3. **File Compression**: Automatically compress large images
4. **Preview Generation**: Generate thumbnails for images and PDFs
5. **Download Tracking**: Track which students downloaded which files
6. **Bulk Upload**: Allow teachers to upload multiple assignments at once
7. **Assignment Templates**: Save and reuse assignment templates
8. **File Versioning**: Allow teachers to update assignment files
9. **Student Submissions**: Extend to handle student file submissions
10. **Analytics**: Track assignment completion rates and download statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env
- Try `npx prisma db push` instead
- Check for existing migrations conflicts

### File Upload Fails
- Check `public/uploads/assignments/` directory exists and is writable
- Verify file size is under 10MB
- Check file type is in allowed list
- Review server logs for detailed errors

### Modal Doesn't Open
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CreateAssignmentModal is imported correctly
- Ensure Dialog component from shadcn/ui is installed

### Files Not Displaying
- Verify files are in `public/uploads/assignments/`
- Check file URLs in database are correct
- Ensure Next.js is serving static files from public directory
