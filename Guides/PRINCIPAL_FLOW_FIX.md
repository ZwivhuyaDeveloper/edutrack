# ‚úÖ Principal Flow Fixed

## üêõ **Problem**

When selecting PRINCIPAL role, the flow was bypassing the principal details form and going directly to school setup.

**Incorrect Flow:**
```
1. Select PRINCIPAL role
2. ‚ùå Skip profile form
3. Go directly to school setup
4. Missing principal details!
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution**

Fixed the `handleRoleSelect` function to ensure PRINCIPAL goes through the profile form first.

### **Code Change:**

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const handleRoleSelect = (role: 'STUDENT' | 'TEACHER' | 'PARENT' | 'PRINCIPAL' | 'CLERK') => {
  console.log('Role selected:', role)
  setSelectedRole(role)
  
  if (role === 'PRINCIPAL') {
    setStep('school-setup')  // ‚ùå Skips profile form!
  } else {
    setStep('school')
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const handleRoleSelect = (role: 'STUDENT' | 'TEACHER' | 'PARENT' | 'PRINCIPAL' | 'CLERK') => {
  console.log('Role selected:', role)
  setSelectedRole(role)
  
  // All roles go to profile form first to collect their details
  // PRINCIPAL will then go to school-setup after profile
  // Other roles will go to school selection after profile
  setStep('profile')  // ‚úÖ Everyone goes to profile first!
}
```

1. User signs up with Clerk
   ‚Üí Email/password or OAuth
